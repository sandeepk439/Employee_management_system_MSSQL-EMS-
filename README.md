# Employee_management_system_MSSQL-EMS-
This project is an Employee Management System (EMS) built using MS SQL Server.
I'm building this project to demonstrates core database skills like designing tables, writing stored procedures, and generating reports. 
The system manages employee data, salaries, departments, and performance reviews.
